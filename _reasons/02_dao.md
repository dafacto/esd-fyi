title: Earn ESD with the DAO
intro: Lock your ESD in the DAO to earn ESD during expansion.
---

When the ESD protocol is in expansion, i.e. the TWAP is greater than $1, 77.5% of new emissions are awarded to people who have staked—or “bonded”—some ESD in the DAO. The APR on bonding rewards has been as high as 3,500%!

Here’s how it works:

1. Your ESD must be staked, or “bonded” in the DAO, in order to earn rewards. If you don’t have any ESD, you can [buy some at Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48&outputCurrency=0x36f3fd68e7325a35eb768f1aedaae9ea0689d723).
2. The first step and transaction is to deposit, or “stage”, your ESD in the DAO section of the ESD platform.
3. Once staged, the final step and transaction is to “bond” your ESD. Once bonded, you will begin receiving ESD rewards after each epoch while the protocol is in expansion, and these rewards will auto-compound into your bonded balance!

Important things to know:

- When you bond ESD in the DAO, there is a 15 epoch delay—i.e. 120 hours, or five days—before you can withdraw it, *or bond additional ESD* (so think carefully about how much you want to deposit as you’ll have to wait a week to deposit more!)
- The lock status is shown under “Status” in the ESD platform. When locked, you’ll be shown after which epoch it becomes unlocked.
- Any bonding interaction will reset the 15 epoch delay.
- Technically, when the TWAP is greater than $1, the DAO earns rewards *only after all coupons have been made redeemable*. We’ll learn about coupons in a bit.
- When ESD is in contractions, no rewards are earned.
