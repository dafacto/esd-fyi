title: What is Empty Døllar Set?
intro: An algorithmic stablecoin to power the future of finance!
---

Empty Døllar Set — or ESD — is a cryptocurrency whose value is designed to track the US Dollar. Unlike stablecoins that are backed by physical dollars, such as USDC or USDT, and unlike stablecoins that are backed by collateral, such as DAI, ESD is a stablecoin whose value is maintained through market forces.

Here’s how it works, in a nutshell:

1. **Supple Expansion** — When the market price of ESD is greater than $1, the protocol emits new ESD coins. This increase in supply should drive the price lower. New ESD emissions are given to people who lock up ESD in the “DAO”, as well as to people who provide trading liquidity on Uniswap.

2. **Supply Contraction** — When the market price of ESD is less than $1, the protocol pauses emissions, and begins offering "coupons" (debt) for sale at a premium, meaning you can buy $1 worth of ESD for some amount less than $1. You pay for coupons by "burning" ESD. The burning of ESD reduces the supply, which should drive the price higher.
These two see-saw mechanisms are designed to work in tandem to keep the price of ESD oscillating around one US Dollar. 

In order to attenuate dramatic changes in liquidity in the DAO and on Uniswap, the ESD protocol includes some built-in withdrawal delays, which are calculated in units of “epochs”. One epoch is eight hours.

In order to dampen volatility, changes in expansion and contraction are not triggered by the current market price of ESD, but rather the “TWAP”, or time-weighted average price.

Let’s now explore those three ways to earn ESD, [beginning with the DAO.](/earn-with-dao//) →
