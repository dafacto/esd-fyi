title: Who runs Empty Døllar Set Finance?
intro: Empty Døllar Set is an anonymous organization, guided through community governance.
---

The Empty Døllar Set Finance project was conceived and launched by a number of anonymous developers, inspired by the innovative ground broken by Yearn Finance, but focused on providing a more cohesive user experience.

The Empty Døllar Set founders knew, however, that the best crypto projects are community led, and so a governance system was implemented beginning with proposal discussions on the [Empty Døllar Set Forum](https://forum.Empty Døllar Set.finance), followed by voting on the [Snapshot platform](https://snapshot.page/#/Empty Døllar Set). These proposals then guide the direction in which the development team evolve the platform.

Finally, one of the most vibrant communities in DeFi has emerged around Empty Døllar Set Finance, primarily at the [project Discord](http://discord.gg/gR85hmC). If you’re excited about Empty Døllar Set, we’d love for you to join the conversation!
