title: Empty Set Døllar Governance
intro: Get involved, and help shape the future of ESD!
---

The Empty Set Døllar project intends to operate as a “DAO”, or *decentralized autonomous organization*, allowing those who have ESD bonded in the DAO to propose on and vote for proposals that shape the evolution of the protocol.

Here’s how it works:

1. Proposals are created and discussed in dedicated channels in the [ESD project Discord](https://discord.gg/vPws9Vp).

2. Proposals that proceed to vote are added to the Governance screen of the ESD platform.

3. If you have ESD bonded in the DAO, you can click the “Go To” button on any active proposal, and vote in favor or against the proposal.

At this point, you know all the basics of Empty Set Døllar!

The last step of your introduction is a peek at some [helpful resources to get you started](/resources/)!
