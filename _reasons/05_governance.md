title: Empty Døllar Set Governance
intro: Get involved, and help shape the future of ESD!
---

The Empty Døllar Set project intends to operate as a “DAO”, or decentralized autonomous organization, allowing those who have ESD bonded in the DAO to propose on and vote for proposals that shape the evolution of the protocol.

Here’s how it works:

1. Proposals are created and discussed in dedicated channels in the [ESD project Discord](https://discord.gg/vPws9Vp).

2. Proposals that proceed to vote are added to the Governance screen of the ESD app.

3. If you have ESD bonded in the DAO, you can click the “Go To” button on any active proposal, and vote in favor or against the proposal. ESD use a “quadratic voting” mechanism, that weights votes according to the amount of ESD held, but with a decaying factor that allows broader and fairer participation, decreasing the influence of “whales”.

At this point, you know all the basics of Empty Døllar Set!
