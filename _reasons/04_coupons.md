title: Earn ESD with the Coupons
intro: Purchase coupons at a premium when ESD is in contraction.
---

When ESD is in contraction, i.e. the TWAP is less than $1, the protocol sells *coupons* at a premium. This means for each 1 ESD worth of coupons, you’ll pay something less than 1 ESD, and later be able to redeem them for 1 ESD, when the protocol is again in expansion.

To pay for coupons, you will “burn” your ESD, thereby destroying them. Burning ESD results in decreasing the total ESD supply, which should have the effect of increasing the market price of ESD, brining it back towards a value of $1.

Purchasing coupons can be very profitable. For example, if you bought 1 ESD of coupons for 0.75 ESD, and redeemed them for 1 ESD in a week, that’s an annualized return of roughly 1,400%!

What is the risk? The risk is that *purchased coupons expire after 90 epochs, or approximately 30 days*. This means that if ESD doesn’t enter expansion during that time, your coupons expire worthless.

With that as background, here’s how it works:

1.  When ESD is in contraction, visit the Coupons section of the website, to purchase coupons.
2.  The current “premium”, or purchase discount, will be displayed.
3.  You purchase coupons by using the “Burn” button on the screen.
4.  Currently held coupons are listed at the bottom of the page.
5.  When ESD is in expansion, you can “redeem” each coupon for 1 ESD on this same page.

Easy peasy!

Now that you’ve learned about earning ESD through the DAO, as a liquidity provider, and with coupons, the last thing to learn about is governance.
