title: Earn ESD with the DAO
intro: Lock your ESD in the DAO to earn ESD during expansion.
---

When the ESD protocol is in expansion, approximately 80% of all new emissions are awarded to people who have staked—or "bonded"—some ESD in the DAO.

Here's how it works:

1. Before you can stake, or "bond", your ESD in the DAO, you first need to deposit, or "stage", it at the ESD website.

2. Once staged, you can then "bond" your ESD with a second transaction. Once bonded, you will begin receiving ESD rewards when the protocol is in expansion, and these rewards will auto-compound into your bonded balance!
