title: Earn ESD as a Liquidity Provider
intro: Lock your Uniswap LP tokens to earn ESD during expansion.
---

When the ESD protocol is in expansion—i.e. the TWAP is greater than $1—approximately 20% of new emissions are awarded to liquidity providers, or “LPs”. Liquidity providers are people who deposit both ESD and USDC at Uniswap, to facilitate trading. The APR on LP rewards has been as high as 2,000%!

Here’s how it works:

1.  Step one is to deposit equal USD-value amounts of ESD and USDC into the [Uniswap liquidity pool](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x36f3fd68e7325a35eb768f1aedaae9ea0689d723/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48). As a receipt of deposit, you’ll receive  “Uniswap LP tokens”.
2.  Step two is to deposit, or “stage”, those Uniswap LP tokens in the Liquidity section of the ESD platform.
3.  Once staged, the final step is to “bond” those LP tokens. Once bonded, you will begin receiving ESD rewards while the protocol is in expansion!

Important things to know:

- When you bond LP tokens, there is a 5 epoch delay—i.e. 40 hours, or 1.6 days—before you can withdraw them, or bond additional tokens. 
- Your lock status is displayed under “Pool Status”. If locked, you’ll be shown after which epoch your pool becomes unlocked.
- Any interaction with bonding will reset the 5 epoch delay.
- When ESD is in contraction, no rewards are earned, although you will continue to earn trading fees at Uniswap.
- Unlike the DAO, LP rewards are in the form of *claimable ESD tokens*. These rewards will appear as your “Rewarded” balance on the Liquidity screen.
- There are two things you can do with your rewards, *claim* them, or *provide* them as additional liquidity.

Claiming ESD rewards:

- To *claim* your ESD rewards, you have to temporarily unbond your LP tokens. After unbonding, your ESD rewards will appear as your “Claimable” balance. 
- After unbonding, be sure to immediately re-bond your LP tokens, to continue receiving rewards!
- Since an interaction with bonding happened, the 5-epoch timer resets, and you will need to wait until this delay passes before being able to withdraw your ESD. 
- When your pool status is again unlocked, you can use the Claim button to withdraw your ESD. Withdrawing your ESD at this point does not involve a bonding interaction, and will not reset your lock timer.

Providing ESD rewards back to the liquidity pool:

- To provide your rewarded ESD as additional liquidity, you simply use the “Provide” button. The website will calculate the USD equivalent in USDC that you’ll need to have available in your wallet, to match the ESD you are trying to provide.
- You don’t have to provide your full rewards balance; you can enter a smaller amount if you wish.
- Providing additional liquidity this way does not trigger a new 5-epoch delay.
