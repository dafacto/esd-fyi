title: Earn ESD as a Liquidity Provider
intro: Lock your Uniswap LP tokens to earn ESD during expansion.
---

When the ESD protocol is in expansion, approximately 20% of new emissions are awarded to liquidity providers, or "LPs". Liquidity providers are people who deposit both ESD and USDC at Uniswap, to facilitate trading. The APR on LP rewards has been as high as 2,000%!

Here's how it works:

1.  Deposit equal amounts of ESD and USDC into the [Uniswap liquidity pool](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x36f3fd68e7325a35eb768f1aedaae9ea0689d723/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48). As a receipt of deposit, you'll receive some "Uniswap LP tokens".
2.  The next step is to deposit, or "stage", your Uniswap LP tokens in the Liquidity section of the ESD website.
3.  Once staged, the final step is to "bond" your LP tokens. Once bonded, you will begin receiving ESD rewards when the protocol is in expansion!

Important things to know:

- When you bond LP tokens, there is a 5 epoch delay—i.e. 40 hours, or 1.6 days—before you can withdraw it, or bond additional LP tokens. 
- The lock status is shown as the "Pool Status". When locked, you'll be shown after which epoch it becomes unlocked.
- Any bonding interaction will reset the 5 epoch delay.
- Unlike the DAO, LP rewards are in the form of claimable ESD tokens. These rewards will appear as your "Rewarded" balance on the Liquidity screen.
- There are two things you can do with your rewards, *claim* them, or *provide* them back into your LP funds.

Claiming ESD rewards:

- To *claim* your ESD rewards, you have to unbond your LP tokens. After unbonding, your ESD rewards will appear as your "Claimable" balance. 
- After unbonding, be sure to immediately bond your LP tokens again, to continue receiving rewards!
- Since an interaction with bonding happened, the 5-epoch timer restarts before you can withdraw those ESD using the Claim button. 
- When your pool status is unlocked, you can use the Claim button to withdraw your ESD. Claiming your ESD at this point does not involve a bonding interaction, and so withdrawing them will not reset your lock timer.

Providing ESD rewards back to the liquidity pool:

- To provide your rewarded ESD as additional liquidity, you simply use the "Provide" button. The ESD website will calculate the USD equivalent in USDC that you'll need to have in your wallet, to match the ESD you are trying to provide.
- You don't have to provide your full rewards balance; you can enter a smaller amount if you wish.
- Providing additional liquidity this was does not reset your pool lock counter!
